# Twitter-s-Impact-on-Financial-Markets-Analyzing-Pfizer-AstraZeneca-and-SinoPharm-Case-Study

Data Management Project at University of Milano Bicocca - Data Science.

The project aimed to understand if tweets related to a particular company influence the stock market trends of that company. To answer this question, we focused on three different pharmaceutical companies that produced COVID19 vaccines: Sinopharm, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer. We extracted tweets containing the name of at least one of the three companies and integrated them with stock market data. The visualizations allowed us to represent the daily and hourly trends of the number of tweets and the stock market trends, including additional parameters such as sentiment and tweet engagement. However, the infographics did not provide a clear judgment regarding a possible link between the two trends. Python Notebook was used for the data integration part, and Tableau was used for the graphical visualizations.

##The project included two folders: The first folder named "Data gathering" contains python notebooks related to data collection:

1.A-Snscraper: Used to collect tweets
1.B-Data stock: Used to collect stock data
2.A-Data merge stock: Used to merge stock datasets
3.A-Integration_Sinopharm: Integration of Sinopharm tweets and stocks
3.B-Integration_Astrazeneca: Integration of Astrazeneca tweets and stocks
3.C-Integration_Pfizer: Integration of Pfizer tweets and stocks

##In the "Real-time" folder, you can find:

Kafka producer and consumer for financial data and tweets, with the Nifi workflow
The integration folder contains real-time integrations.
