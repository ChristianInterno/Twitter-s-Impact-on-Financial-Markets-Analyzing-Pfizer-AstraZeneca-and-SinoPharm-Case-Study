> **A Data Management Project at the University of Milano Bicocca - Data Science.** 

This project delves into understanding the potential influence of tweets on stock market trends. We've focused our study on three prominent pharmaceutical companies that played pivotal roles during the COVID-19 pandemic by producing vaccines: **Sinopharm**, **AstraZeneca**, and **Pfizer**. By integrating tweet data with stock market trends, we aim to uncover any correlations and insights into the interplay of social media sentiment and stock market fluctuations.

## üìà Project Highlights

1. **Tweet Extraction**: Gathered tweets containing mentions of the three pharmaceutical companies.
2. **Stock Data Integration**: Combined tweet data with stock market data to observe potential correlations.
3. **Visualization**: Utilized Tableau to graphically represent daily and hourly trends, incorporating sentiment analysis and tweet engagement metrics.
4. **Real-time Data Workflow**: Leveraged Kafka and Nifi for real-time financial data and tweet integrations.

## ü§î Findings

While our visualizations beautifully represent the intertwined nature of tweets and stock market trends, a definitive correlation between the two could not be conclusively determined. However, the methodologies and the workflow established can serve as a foundation for more extensive future studies.
